# C++ Shooter Game - Callum Slowley
## Game design, 2 in unique game mechanics
The first unique game mechanic I want adding into my shooter is that, after the player kills an enemy they will a pick up which will improve the players stats. So the better you are and the longer you last the stronger you get.
For my second  unique game mechanic I want different enemy types that split into smaller enemies to make it so if the player just shoots no stop they will quickly get swarmed
